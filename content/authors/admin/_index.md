Hi, I'm Nathan.
I'm currently working as AI Software Engineer at [IntellectEU](https://www.intellecteu.com/), where I work on machine learning and AI projects in the financial sector.
Before that, I did a machine learning PhD at the [LIIR lab](https://liir.cs.kuleuven.be/) at KU Leuven.

This site is intended on the one hand as a point of contact for people interested in working with me, so you can find my [contact details](#contact) and my [CV](#cv) here.

On the other hand, it will act as a non-peer-reviewed public deposit for my opinions and thoughts, in the form of [blog posts](#posts).
