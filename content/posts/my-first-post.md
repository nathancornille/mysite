[comment]: <> (GOAL?)

[comment]: <> (- archival purposes &#40;but a private notebook does this just as well&#41;)

[comment]: <> (- ~portfolio for future employers/collaborators: I craft nuggets of insight/thought, and the finest one I put on display here)

[comment]: <> (- external-motivation: needing to meet the minimum quality standard for _the public_)

[comment]: <> (- joy of crafting something, and having it be seen)

[comment]: <> (So, I finally decided to make my own blog. No longer will the world be bereft of my sharp take on things, my wit and my candor üôè.)

[comment]: <> (My motivation, I think, comes from a particular flavour of happiness I'm looking for: the feeling of _craftsmanship_. )
