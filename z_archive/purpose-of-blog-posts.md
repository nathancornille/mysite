[comment]: <> (GOAL?)

[comment]: <> (- archival purposes &#40;but a private notebook does this just as well&#41;)

[comment]: <> (- ~portfolio for future employers/collaborators: I craft nuggets of insight/thought, and the finest one I put on display here)

[comment]: <> (- external-motivation: needing to meet the minimum quality standard for _the public_)

[comment]: <> (- joy of crafting something, and having it be seen)

[comment]: <> (So, I finally decided to make my own blog. No longer will the world be bereft of my sharp take on things, my wit and my candor üôè.)

[comment]: <> (My motivation, I think, comes from a particular flavour of happiness I'm looking for: the feeling of _craftsmanship_. )


- urge to create
-


In a nutshell, I :
- Improving my thoughts, by : Writing down my thoughts, long-form, might force them to become more coherent. Not unlike how you can have the feeling you understand an algorithm, but realize you skipped over some details in your understanding when you have to actually implement it in code.
- Putting my thoughts in the open, rather than leaving them in the echo chamber of my head. Letting them interact with the thoughts in other brains might improve them.
- It feels good to be valuable to someone: just like it can make my day to help someone in the supermarket to reach some high-up-the-shelf product, maybe it can make my day if my thoughts on some topic helped/interested some stranger on the internet

What kind of posts will they be?
- maybe on topics I think about in my phd. Technical topics, like the meaning of causal representation learning, or meta-topics, like planning what to work on when in a phd, or how to pick a topic.
