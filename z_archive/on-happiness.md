- happiness = very important. In some interpretation of the word, it is _the_ important thing. When people say "happiness is not the most important thing to me, but [justice,peace,curiosity, ...] is". This is because they have 'cheerfulness' in mind. Why do they prefer e.g., 'justice' over cheerfulness? Because in the end, they _feel better_ about the 'just' outcome of some decision, than about the cheerful outcome.
Now, this 'feeling better' is the notion of interest, I'll use the word 'happiness' for that.

- What is it, really?
  - Happiness is a feeling, an emotion. If you don't believe in strong emergence, then the event of having an emotion is a coarse-grained way-of-talking about a particular micro-level Let's look at the m:
    - Sequence of events:
      - happy-hormones colliding with their receptors in your brain. Serotonin, dopamine, oxytocin, endorphin.
      - this receptor-binding
  - = a tool given by evolution to encourage survival-useful-behaviours/states and discourage detrimental ones by associating happy resp. unhappy feelings with each.
  The 'feeling' then leads to organism enacting change-seeking behaviour when it is negative, and status-quo-preserving behaviour when it is positive.
